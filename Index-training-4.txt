To identify a poorly performing SQL statement, consider elapsed time, CPU time, and getpages.  If a statement has been running on a regular basis, and any or all of these are consistently increasing, it is an indication of performance degradation.  If the statement is new (has not been running on a regular basis), if any or all of these are much higher by comparison with other statements in the workload, it should be investigated for opportunities to improve performance.
