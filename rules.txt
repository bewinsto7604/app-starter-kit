RULE:Deadlocks;ITEM=QTXADEA; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This statement has experienced a deadlock.  To avoid deadlocks, insure
that applications access tables in the same order.
*
RULE:Timeouts;ITEM=QTXATIM; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This statement has experienced a timeout.
*
RULE:Escalations;ITEM=QTXALEX+QTXALES; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This statement has experienced lock escalations, where the maximum
page locks per tablespace are exceeded.  The maximum lock value is
specified in DB2 install panel DSNTIPJ.
*
RULE:Timeouts per Escalation;RATIO=QTXADEA+QTXATIM/QTXALEX+QTXALES; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This statement experienced a timeout or deadlock, most likely due to
lock escalation.
*
RULE:SyncIO Wait percentage;PERCENTAGE=SYNCWAIT/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a large percentage of time performing
synchronous I/Os.  If the getpage count has risen, it can indicate
a need to rebind the program, update catalog statistics for accessed
objects, or reorganize affected objects.  Also check for RID list
failures for the statement and buffer pool performance for accessed
objects.
*
RULE:Getpage count;ITEM=GETPAGES(31, 0);
REPORT:ALWAYS
*
RULE:Getpages per SyncIO;RATIO=GETPAGES(31, 1)/QBACRIO; < 2
This execution invoked a high level of synchronous I/O activity
in proportion to getpages.  This can indicate a need to tune the
buffer pool(s) involved.  Also check for the need to reorganize
accessed objects using the REORG Advisor, and evaluate the access
path chosen using Workload Compare.
*
RULE:Lock wait percentage;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTL/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting on locks or
latches.  You can use EXPLAIN to determine the locking characteristics
of this statement; you can get details on locking activity with
BMC AMI Ops for Db2.
*
RULE:Drain wait percentage;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWDR/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting on drain locks.
You can use EXPLAIN to determine the locking characteristics
of this statement; you can get details on locking activity with
BMC AMI Ops for Db2.
*
RULE:Claim release wt pct;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWCL/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting on drain locks
while waiting for a claim to be released.
You can use EXPLAIN to determine the locking characteristics
of this statement; you can get details on locking activity with
BMC AMI Ops for Db2.
*
RULE:Page latch wait pct;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTP/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting on page latches.
This could be an issue with concurrently running RUNSTATS or COPY
utilities with SHRLEVL(CHANGE) option.
*
RULE:Notify messages wt;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTG/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting due to the
sending of messages to other data sharing group members.  This could be
related to object changes due to DDL.
*
RULE:Global contention;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTJ/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting due to global
contention for parent L-locks, required for inter-system communication.
*
RULE:Child L-Lock wait;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTK/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting due to global
contention for child L-locks, required for inter-system communication.
*
RULE:Other L-Lock wait;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTM/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting due to global
contention for other L-locks, required for inter-system communication.
*
RULE:Pageset P-Lock wt;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTN/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting due to global
contention for pageset or partition P-locks, required for inter-system
communication.
*
RULE:Page P-Lock wait;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTO/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting due to global
contention for page P-locks, required for inter-system
communication.
*
RULE:Other P-Lock wait;PERCENTAGE=QWACAWTQ/ELAPTIME; > 30
This execution spent a high percentage of time waiting due to global
contention for other P-locks, required for inter-system
communication.
*
RULE:RLF Parallel Disablements;ITEM=QXRLFDPA; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
Query parallelism was disabled by the Resource Limit Facility.
*
RULE:Reduced Degree Parallelism;ITEM=QXREDGRP; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
The number of parallel groups did not reach the planned level due to
buffer pool limitations.  Increase the size of the buffer pool in which
objects accessed by this statement reside.
*
RULE:Buffer Pool Parallel Disablement;ITEM=QXDEGBUF; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This query fell back to sequential mode due to buffer pool limitations.
Increase the size of the buffer pool in which objects accessed by this
statement reside.
*
RULE:Curser Parallel Disablement;ITEM=QXDEGCUR; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This query fell back to sequential mode due to a cursor that can be
used by UPDATE or DELETE.
*
RULE:ESA Parallel Disablement;ITEM=QXDEGESA; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This query fell back to sequential mode due to lack of ESA sort support.
*
RULE:Coordinator=N Single DB2;ITEM=QXCOORNO; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This query executed on only one DB2 subsystem because the coordinator
subsystem value is set to NO.
*
RULE:Isolation Single DB2;ITEM=QXISORR; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
This query executed on only one DB2 subsystem because the isolation is
set for repeatable-read or read-stability.
*
RULE:Config Reformulate Par;ITEM=QXREPOP1; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
The parallel query was reformulated because the number of data sharing
groups differed between bind time and run time.
*
RULE:Buffer Reformulate Par;ITEM=QXREPOP2; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
The parallel query was reformulated because one or more members of the
data sharing group had insufficient buffer pool resources.
*
RULE:Skipped members;ITEM=QXXCSKIP; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
The parallel query processing had to skip members in the data sharing
group due to inadequate buffer pool size at the member(s).
*
RULE:DTT SIngle DB2;ITEM=QXDEGDTT; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
The query executed on only one DB2 subsystem because a declared
temporary table was detected during execution of a user-defined
function.
*
RULE:Limit RID Failure;ITEM=QXMRMIAP; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
List prefetch processing failed because a RID list exceeded the
internal limit specified on DB2 installation panel DSNTIPC.
*
RULE:Storage RID Failure;ITEM=QXNSMIAP; > 0
HISTORY:Threshold
List prefetch processing failed because no storage was available
to hold a RID list.
