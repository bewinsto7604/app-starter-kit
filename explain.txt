       BMC184750S-This query references one or more tables that are missing
                  cardinality statistics.
       BMC184746W-DB2 does not have enough information for a reasonable cost
                  estimate. Default values were used.
       BMC184028I-The tables referenced in the FROM clause are fully
                  qualified. This will limit the flexibility for the
                  qualifier to be resolved at bind time.

       BMC184402W-The table will be accessed using a tablespace scan. Unless
                  most rows in this table are retrieved, an appropriate
                  index would be more efficient.
       BMC184428W-The table data pages will be accessed to satisfy this
                  portion of the query. This requires additional overhead.
       BMC184456W-The LOCK mode for this access is Intent SHARE.
       BMC184468W-The data will be retrieved using Sequential Prefetch.
       BMC184476W-Column function evaluation is not used OR column function
                  evaluation will be determined at execution time.
       BMC184384I-This table is the first table accessed in the query:
